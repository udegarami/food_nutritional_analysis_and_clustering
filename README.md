[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing nutritional information about various food products. The notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and clustering techniques to identify distinct food clusters.

## Dataset

The dataset, stored in 'cleaned.csv', includes information about different food products and their corresponding nutritional values per 100 grams, such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, sugars, sodium, and energy content.

## Contents

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration:** Load the dataset, visualize outliers, explore correlations, and perform statistical tests.
2. **Clustering with KMeans:** Apply KMeans clustering on the data to identify similar food clusters.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Perform dimensionality reduction using PCA.
4. **Recipe Generator:** Create a simple recipe generator based on dominant macronutrients.

## How to Use

1. Ensure Python 3.9, Jupyter Notebook, and required libraries are installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Download the 'cleaned.csv' dataset and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step.
